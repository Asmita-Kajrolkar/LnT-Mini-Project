## Introduction
Fitness Calculator will help you calculate Body Mass Index(BMI), Basal Metabolic Rate(BMR) and Calorie requirements according to your BMR. BMI and BMR Calculators are widely used by persons on a weight loss regime where suggests body mass and is a measurement of your body composition from your height and weight and BMR shows how much calories your body burns when at rest.

## What is BMI
BMI calculates how much fat your body has and understands your body weight and height to standardise your build. BMI finds out whether you are underweight, overweight, obese or ideal.

## BMI Calculations
BMI(Body Mass Index) is a number calculated from a person's weight and height.
Using the two important factors-height and weight, you can calculate BMI as follows-
#### `Body Mass Index = Weight(in kg) / (Height(in metres) * Height(in metres))`
If the numbers shows that your BMI is above normal or below the normal range, you should get yourself checked by a doctor at least once every six months or at least once a year.
Both high BMI's and low ones are known to raise a host of health problems.

### Classification of Weight Status by Body Mass Index(BMI)
| Classification           | BMI           |
| -------------            | ------------- |
| Underweight              | <18.5         |
| Normal Weight            | 18.5-24.9     |
| Overweight               | 25-29.9       |
| Obesity Class 1          | 30-34.9       |
| Obesity Class 2          | 35-39.9       |
| Extreme Obesity Class 3  | >40           |

## What is BMR
Basal Metabolic Rate is a measurement of the number of calories needed to perform your body's most basic functions.

## BMR Calculations
BMR(Basal Metabolic Rate) is a number calculated from a person's weight, height and age.
Using the three important factors-height, age and weight, you can calculate BMR as follows-
#### `Basal Metabolic Rate(for women) = 655 + (9.6 * weight(in kg)) + (1.8 * height(in cm)) - (4.7 * age(in years))`
#### `Basal Metabolic Rate(for men) = 66 + (13.7 * weight(in kg)) + (5 * height(in cm)) - (6.8 * age(in years))`

### Classification of Calorie Intake according to Basal Metabolic Rate(BMR)
| Activity Level           | Calorie Requirement          |
| -------------            | ------------- |
| Little to no exercise              | BMR*1.2         |
| Light Exercise           | BMR*1.375     |
| Moderate Exercise               | BMR*1.55       |
| Heavy Exercise        | BMR*1.725       |
| very Heavy Exercise          | BMR*1.9       |
